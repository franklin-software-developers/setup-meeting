# GitHub
GitHub is a powerful website/application that allows developers to store and share their projects with other users on the web. Users can also track and control past changes in their code. <br>
All major tech companies (i.e. Airbnb, Netflix, LinkedIn, Facebook) use GitHub or services like it to help manage/track changes in their massive codebases and facilitate multiple developers working on the same feature.

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Forking
Forking is an action that can be done within GitHub. It allows you to copy someone else's repository (coding project).<br>
Think of making a copy of someone's Google Doc and making your own changes. The changes you make in your copy does not affect the older Google Doc you copied from.<br>
<strong>In most of our meetings, you will need to fork repositories from our organization and add your changes to it.</strong>
