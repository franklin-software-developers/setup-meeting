# 😻 **GitHub**
GitHub is a powerful website/application that allows developers to store and share their projects with other users on the web. Users can also track and control past changes in their code. <br>
All major tech companies (i.e. Airbnb, Netflix, LinkedIn, Facebook) use GitHub or services like it to help manage/track changes in their massive codebases and facilitate multiple developers working on the same feature.
