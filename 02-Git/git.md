# Install Git
Open Ubuntu-20.04 Terminal in VSCode and type:
```
bash
```
Tell Git who you are
```
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Your name"
```

If this returns a version number, Git's already installed.
```
git --version
```

That's all we need to do with Git for now. More about it in three meetings.
