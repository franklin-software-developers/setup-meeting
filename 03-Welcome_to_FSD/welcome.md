# **Welcome to Franklin Software Developers!**
Thanks for your interest in our club!
<br>
We are very excited to have you join our first meeting!
<br>
Let's review this message together:

## ‚≠êÔ∏è **Our Goal**
Our goal as FSD is to introduce and form technical and collaboration skills used in real-world software careers in our club members.

## üíª **Laptop List**
Please write your name on this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j9Qb_61J1rDr-baKMJC49y9E58KNPMjUvbD0iF0bv80/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Google Sheet</a> to be assigned to a laptop for the rest of the year. <br>


## üìù **Background Survey**
Please fill out this quick <a href="https://forms.gle/M1MpTCQPYNCbwexq8" target="_blank">Google Form</a> so I can understand everyone's experience levels and adapt the club to better match your backgrounds and interests. <br>

## üß† **Growth Mindset**
A growth mindset is the practiced belief that developing a skill comes from "dedication and hard work‚Äîbrains and talent are just the starting point"<sup><a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/opinion-carol-dweck-revisits-the-growth-mindset/2015/09?cmp=cpc-goog-ew-growth%20mindset&ccid=growth%20mindset&ccag=growth%20mindset&cckw=%2Bgrowth%20%2Bmindset&cccv=content%20ad&gclid=Cj0KEQiAnvfDBRCXrabLl6-6t-0BEiQAW4SRUM7nekFnoTxc675qBMSJycFgwERohguZWVmNDcSUg5gaAk3I8P8HAQ" target="_blank">1</a></sup>
<br><br>
In this club specifically, this means:
- Asking other members or me questions, especially asking 'basic' ones
- Answering a question though you're unsure if it's right
- Persevering and trying to fix errors in your code
- Believing you can become a skilled programmer through practice and hard work

## ‚úÖ **Check-In Surveys**
At the end of most meetings, I release a quick survey that 'checks-in' on your understanding. <br>
More than anything, this is used to help me calibrate future lesson plans.

## üí° **For Members With Prior Experience**
Thanks for coming to our meeting! <br>
It is very likely you will finish early. In that case, please ask other members if they need help.

## üôÄ **Leadership Position Openings**
Officers will: 
- Walk around the classroom to help members with challenges and answer questions.
- Attend at least 80% of all meetings in the year.
- Complete this <a href="https://forms.gle/9pUaAzYT1GjmfkLk9" target="_blank">application form</a>

## üóÇÔ∏è **Meeting Structure**
<details>
<summary>Won't be reviewed but if you'd like to preview:</summary>
Most of our meetings follow this plan: 
<ol> 
<li>Open laptops</li>
<li>Members get a prewritten document that somewhat looks like this:
    <img src="images/meeting-structure.jpeg">
    <ul>
    <li>I live code and explain the "Tutorial" section</li>
        <ul style=‚Äúlist-style-type:square‚Äù>
            <li>You can choose to code along with me or just watch</li>
            <li>I will also ask members to make predictions on what the code will output</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Under the "Challenge" section, you get your hands on the keyboard and practice what you've just learn</li>
    </ul>
</li>
1. At the end of the meeting I unlock a Check-In survey to see how comfortable you are with the material
